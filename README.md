# Simple-Percentage-Bar

It's a code to create a Percentage Bar. You need technologies such as HTML5, CSS and PHP.

Sometimes we need show or compare categories. 
It's a good idea to use horizontal graphics bars. You only need two DIVS. The first one is a CONTAINER and the second one is a bar. It bar has a WIDTH calculating in PERCENTAGE (%).

For example you can use it for compare:
- Sports team. (What is the best for you? Real Madrid?, Barcelona? LDA (Costa Rica ;-)  )

- Sales.

- Budgets

- Votes
 -Etc..
